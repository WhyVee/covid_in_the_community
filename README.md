Topic (Title):
The estimating effect of COVID-19 on communities by observing the weekly hospital capacity

High level description of project: 
COVID-19 has had a large impact across communities all over the United States. By observing data provided by the Department of Health and Human Services, we will be able to tell not only which states were hit the hardest, but which communities struggled the most. Since the data was gathered on a weekly basis, we will be able to determine the time periods that each community was hit the hardest.
